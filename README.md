# ⚡️Electric Vehicle Analysis: Power BI Dashboard

Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption, market trends, and performance metrics (like range and make/model popularity). Provides key insights for strategic planning in the e-mobility sector.

#  ✨ Key Features & Insights

This dashboard transforms raw EV data into actionable insights, enabling the analysis of the following key areas:

Geographic Adoption: Visualize the distribution and concentration of EVs (BEV/PHEV) across regions, states, or counties to identify adoption hotspots.

Manufacturer & Model Trends: Track the market share, sales growth, and overall vehicle count for top EV manufacturers and popular models over time.

Range & Performance Metrics: Analyze the relationship between a vehicle's electric range, base MSRP, and battery type (BEV vs. PHEV).

Time Series Analysis: Examine the year-over-year (YoY) and month-over-month (MoM) growth in EV registrations to understand market acceleration.

# 💻Technologies & Data Model

This project was built using best practices in data modeling and business intelligence tools.

- **Primary Tool**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

- **Data Source**:Got this data from Kaggle

- **Data Logic (DAX)**: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used for creating complex Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including [e.g. Average Electric Range,count of Vehicles and % of types of Vehicles].

- **Transformation (M-Query)**: M-Query (Power Query) was utilized for all data cleaning, merging for optimal performance.
